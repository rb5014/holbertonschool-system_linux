NAME
       gcc - GNU project C and C++ compiler

SYNOPSIS
       gcc [-c|-S|-E] [-std=standard]
           [-g] [-pg] [-Olevel]
           [-Wwarn...] [-Wpedantic]
           [-Idir...] [-Ldir...]
           [-Dmacro[=defn]...] [-Umacro]
           [-foption...] [-mmachine-option...]
           [-o outfile] [@file] infile...

       Only the most useful options are listed here; see below for the remainder.
       g++ accepts mostly the same options as gcc.

DESCRIPTION
       When you invoke GCC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation, assembly
       and linking.  The "overall options" allow you to stop this process at an
       intermediate stage.  For example, the -c option says not to run the
       linker.  Then the output consists of object files output by the assembler.

       Other options are passed on to one stage of processing.  Some options
       control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself.  Yet other
